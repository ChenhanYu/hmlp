HMLP (High Performance Machine Learning Primitives)
INSTALL
---

HMLP is tested on LINUX and OSX.
Compilation REQUIRES:

Intel or GNU compilers with AVX and OpenMP support (x86);

Intel-16 or later compilers (KNL);

nvcc (NVIDIA GPU).


Configuration:
--------------

Edit set_env.sh for compilation options.

Set HMLP_USE_INTEL = true  to use Intel compilers.
Set HMLP_USE_INTEL = false to use GNU compilers.
Set HMLP_USE_BLAS  = false if you don't have a BLAS library.
Set HMLP_USE_VNL   = true  to activate Intel VML.

The default BLAS library for Intel compiler is MKL, and the
default BLAS for GNU is Netlib (-lblas).


Installation:
-------------

Use cmake:
>source set_env.sh
>mkdir build
>cd build
>cmake ..
>make
>make install


Testing and compilation example:
--------------------------------

The default compilation will also compile all the test drivers.
To run some basic examples from the testing drivers:

>cd test
>./run_hmlp.sh


To us HMLP library you need to include the
header files <hmlp.h> 
and link HMLP statically wich is in ${HMLP_DIR}/build/lib/libhmlp.a.

C/C++ example:
...
#include <hmlp.h>
...

Compilation example:
>icc ... -I$(HMLP_DIR)/build/include $(HMLP_DIR)/build/lib/libgsks.a
