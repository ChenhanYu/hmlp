HMLP (High Performance Machine Learning Primitives)
README
---

Thank you for deciding to give HMLP a try!
This code can be used for direct kernel summation.

See INSTALL on how to install it. 

Kernel summation appears in N-body algorithms for scientific computing 
and machine learning. 

HMLP (High Performance Machine Learning Primitives) is a portable framework 
that provides a high performance memory efficient kernel summation based
on the BLIS framework.

GSKS has several features. For further details of this project, please
check the Githup repo:
