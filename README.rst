HMLP (High Performance Machine Learning Primitives)
README
---

HMLP currently is not an open source project. Do not distribute.



Thank you for deciding to give HMLP a try!
This code can be used directly or pluged into many learning tasks such as
kernel summation, nearest neighbor search, k-means clustering, convolution
networks. It is also possible to create a specific general N-body operator by
using our template frameworks.

See INSTALL on how to install it. 

Kernel summation appears in N-body algorithms for scientific computing 
and machine learning (kernel methods). 

HMLP (High Performance Machine Learning Primitives) is a portable framework 
that provides a high performance memory efficient kernel summation based
on the BLIS framework.

HMLP has several features. For further details of this project, please
check the Githup repo:

Thank you again for being intersted in HMLP!
