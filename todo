- Switch to smart pointer if possible.

-HMLP:

1. need to clean up all gpu memory 
2. migrate DistData to use MPIObject

-GOFMM:

1. The current far field sampling scheme is not optimal for FMM. 
Important samples should be constructed after the far interaction
lists were built.

2. Fix all indices to certain type.
